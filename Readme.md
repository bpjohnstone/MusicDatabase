# Music Database

Back in 2007, I built a small WinForms application to catalogue my rapidly expanding musical collection of CDs and LPs. Said application was written in VB.NET, with the data stored in a MySQL database. While the application has worked well over the years, quite frankly, it's long overdue for a rebuild. 

After many years of use, its limitations have become quite apparent, and there are plenty of things that can be improved, or where extra data and detail can be added. So, for some fun, I'm rebuilding the database from scratch, with the aim to replace the original WinForms application with a nice, new fancy web-based solution.

A new (and big) addition to this version of the database, is that it will also include all of the concerts, gigs and festivals that I've attended over the years (or at least the ones that I can remember!). 

While I've no idea what the final form of this project will look like, the plan is for it to be frequently updated and worked on, and to use it as a test bed to try out new things and new approaches... so let's see how this all turns out!
